# Check CODEOWNERS, REVIEWERS, and Maintainers.txt files.
#
# Only run this check if any of the files modified in the PR
# are CODEOWNERS, REVIEWERS, or Maintainers.txt.
#
# This workflow uses pull_request_target to support passing in
# github_access_token that is not available for pull_request.
# The checkout action checks out the head of the PR.  In this
# specific workflow, this is safe because there are no dependencies
# on any files other that this .yml file and known external actions.
