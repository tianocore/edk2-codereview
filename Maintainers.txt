EDK II Maintainers
==================

This file provides information about the primary maintainers for
EDK II.

In general, you should not privately email the maintainer. You should
email the edk2-devel list, and Cc the package maintainers and
reviewers.

If the package maintainer wants to hand over the role to other people,
the package maintainer should send the patch to update Maintainers.txt
with new maintainer, and the new maintainer should follow up with
an Acked-by or a Reviewed-by.

Descriptions of section entries:

  L: Mailing list that is relevant to this area (default is edk2-devel)
     Patches and questions should be sent to the email list.
  M: Package Maintainer: Cc address for patches and questions. Responsible
     for reviewing and pushing package changes to source control.
  R: Package Reviewer: Cc address for patches and questions. Reviewers help
     maintainers review code, but don't have push access. A designated Package
     Reviewer is reasonably familiar with the Package (or some modules
     thereof), and/or provides testing or regression testing for the Package
     (or some modules thereof), in certain platforms and environments.
  W: Web-page with status/info
  T: SCM tree type and location.  Type is one of: git, svn.
  S: Status, one of the following:
     Supported:  Someone is actually paid to look after this.
     Maintained: Someone actually looks after it.
     Odd Fixes:  It has a maintainer but they don't have time to do
                 much other than throw the odd patch in. See below.
     Orphan:     No current maintainer [but maybe you could take the
                 role as you write your new code].
     Obsolete:   Old code. Something tagged obsolete generally means
                 it has been replaced by a better system and you
                 should be using that.
  F: Files and directories with wildcard patterns.
     A trailing slash includes all files and subdirectory files.
     F:   MdeModulePkg/   all files in and below MdeModulePkg
     F:   MdeModulePkg/*  all files in MdeModulePkg, but not below
     F:   */Pci/*         all files in a directory called Pci, at any depth in
                          the hierarchy, but not below
     One pattern per line.  Multiple F: lines per section acceptable.
  X: Files and directories that are NOT maintained, same rules as F:
     Files exclusions are tested after file matches.
     Can be useful for excluding a specific subdirectory, for instance:
     F:   NetworkPkg/
     X:   NetworkPkg/Ip6Dxe/
     matches all files in and below NetworkPkg excluding NetworkPkg/Ip6Dxe/
  Filenames not caught by any F: rule get matched as being located in the top-
  level directory. (Internally, the script looks for a match called '<default>',
  so please don't add a file called that in the top-level directory.)
